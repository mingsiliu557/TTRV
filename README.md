## 📌 Introduction

Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits — a setup that contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment.  

In this work, we propose **TTRV** to enhance vision–language understanding by **adapting the model on-the-fly at inference time**, without the need for any labeled data.  

Concretely, we extend the **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)** framework by designing rewards based on the **frequency of the base model's output** while inferring on each test sample multiple times. Additionally, we **control the diversity** of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding it for achieving **low entropy** in the output empirical distribution.

Our approach delivers **consistent gains** across both **object recognition** and **visual question answering (VQA)**, with improvements of up to **52.4%** and **29.8%**, respectively, and average boosts of **24.6%** and **10.0%** across 16 datasets.  

Remarkably, on image recognition, **TTRV applied to `Intern-VL-8B` surpasses GPT-4o** by an average of **2.3%** over 8 benchmarks, while remaining highly competitive on VQA — demonstrating that **test-time reinforcement learning can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models**.  

Even in **extremely data-constrained scenarios**, where adaptation is performed on a **single randomly chosen unlabeled test example**, TTRV still yields **non-trivial improvements of up to 5.5%** in recognition tasks.
